# EvoFuse

A React + TypeScript + Vite application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). The dev server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates during development.

### Building for Production

Build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

### Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Linting

Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```
